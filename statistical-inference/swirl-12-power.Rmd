# Power

[Source](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/tree/master/Statistical_Inference/Power)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
sigma <- 4
n <- 16
mu0 <-  30
alpha <- .05
z <- qnorm(1-alpha)
myplot <- function(mua) {
  g = ggplot(data.frame(mu = c(27, 36)), aes(x = mu))
  g = g + stat_function(fun=dnorm, geom = "line", 
                        args = list(mean = mu0, sd = sigma / sqrt(n)), 
                        size = 2, col = "red")
  g = g + stat_function(fun=dnorm, geom = "line", 
                        args = list(mean = mua, sd = sigma / sqrt(n)), 
                        size = 2, col = "blue")
  xitc = mu0 + qnorm(1 - alpha) * sigma / sqrt(n)
  g = g + geom_vline(xintercept=xitc, size = 3)
  print(g)
  invisible()
}
```

In this lesson, as the name suggests, we'll discuss POWER, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, which is good and proper.

Hence you want more POWER.
